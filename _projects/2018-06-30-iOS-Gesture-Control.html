Though these advancements have made operating these devices intuitive and ready-to-hand, there are many instances where the seemingly natural controls appear to be a nuisance. The constraint of having to touch the screen has been very much enforced by the current interaction style, but with the recent advances in technologies, the potential for touchless gesture control is feasible, allowing for a new dimension of interaction between you and your smartphone.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0">In order to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between someone and their iOS devices, we created and utilized a cultural probe to collect data. A cultural probe was done rather than contextual interviews since these inconvenient interactions happen sporadically and intermittently, making contextual inquiries unfeasible.</p>

                        <p>Our cultural probe consisted of two different parts. The first was an index card provided to participants that they used to jot down instances where it was inconvenient to use their phones. The second was a daily online questionnaire with the goal of getting more context and understanding of the fundamental issues and situations that led to these inconvenient events.</p>

                            activities such as working in a lab, playing a sport, and volunteering at a food bank. Inconvenient phone interactions that consistently came up occurred while participants were working with gloves, cooking, washing dishes, or taking a shower. Studies have shown that on average we pickup/check our phones anywhere from 100 to 150 times a day. With that in mind, our participants only reported frustration with a little under 10% of those interactions. However, those instances where it was difficult to interact with their phone often resulted in a disruption with their workflow or whatever they were doing at the time. Although the level of frustration varied greatly across our participants, most of them were receptive to motion gesture features and said they were very likely to try it.

                            With our initial prototype we wanted to focus on designing gestures for apps/features that were commonly used among our cultural probe participants. We also wanted to provide functionality for gestures that we believed would be generally useful. Considering the difficulty of prototyping motion gestures without a working product, we decided to focus our brainstorming on intuitive motion gestures for some basic features.

                            From the cultural probe to the design process, this project provided valuable insights into the steps required and their importance in developing a prototype for an interaction style for a smart device.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Starting with the cultural probe, we quickly learned that our participants were quite similar. Although this was useful because we were able to solidify our findings for a certain group of people, it meant that our prototype may not be well suited to others. Ideally, we wanted more participants in the cultural probe and have them vary in terms of phone usage and background (age, major, etc.)

                        <p>
                            Additionally, we learned about the limitations of a video prototype. Our idea of iPhone motion gestures limited us to making a screen recording that synced hand motions with screen movements. Although it conveyed our idea to the participants quite well, they were unable to actually interact with the prototype. They could really only gauge the product based on one scenario we recorded.

                        <p>
                            Overall, the project was a very valuable learning experience. It was great to get exposure to running a culture probe and developing storyboards, and compare how these methods of gathering information and designing compared to other methods.
